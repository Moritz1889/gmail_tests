### How do I get set up? ###
Tests scripts were prepared in Python. 
There are a couple of things that are necessary to run them:
- Python 3.8.2
- Selenium from: https://pypi.org/project/selenium/
- Chromedriver (already in files): https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

In order to run those .py files:
- In env. like Visual Code Studio, simply right click on the file in the EXPLORER windo and choose "run python file in terminal"
or in the appropriate folder run e.g. 'python3 sample.py'
